## [Unreleased]

## [1.2.3] - 2021-02-??

### Changed

* Added support for CORS configuration of Gloo virtual services (`gloo.virtualservice.spec.virtualHost.cors`) according to [Gloo documentation: CORS](https://docs.solo.io/gloo-edge/latest/guides/security/cors/).
* K8S Secrets conaining the oauth client secrets for OIDC (known as `webeam-oidc` secrets) can now be generated by helm as [`ExternalSecret`](https://github.com/external-secrets/kubernetes-external-secrets) referencing to AWS secrets manager secrets.
* Added HTTP to HTTPS redirect by means of Gloo (see [Gloo documentation: HTTPS Redirect](https://docs.solo.io/gloo-edge/latest/guides/traffic_management/request_processing/https_redirect/)). This is done automatically for all deployments which have a `gloo.virtualservice.spec.virtualHost.routes.callbackUrlPath` configured. Such deployments are treated as user interfaces where a HTTP to HTTPS redirect should be provided for user convenience.
